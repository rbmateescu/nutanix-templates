### Define Provider Info for terraform-provider-nutanix
### This is where you define the credentials for ** Prism Central **
###
### NOTE:
###   While it may be possible to use Prism Element directly, Nutanix's
###   provider is not structured or tested for this. Using Prism Central will
###   give the broadest capabilities across the board
provider "nutanix" {
}

### Define Script Local Variables
### This can be used for any manner of things, but is useful for like clusterid,
###   to store a mapping of targets for provisioning
### TODO: Need to make clusters a data source object, such that consumers do
###       not need to manually provision cluster ID
locals {
  cluster1   = "${var.cluster}"
}

##########################
### Data Sources
##########################
### These are "lookups" to simply define an already existing object as a
### plain text name
### This is useful when managing a nutanix prism central instance from multiple
### state files, or deploying terraform into an existing / brownfield environment
### Virtual Machine Data Sources
# data "nutanix_virtual_machine" "nutanix_virtual_machine" {
#   vm_id = "${nutanix_virtual_machine.vm1.id}"
# }
### Image Data Sources
# data "nutanix_image" "test" {
#     metadata = {
#         kind = "image"
#     }
#     image_id = "${nutanix_image.test.id}"
# }
### Subnet Data Sources
# data "nutanix_subnet" "next-iac-managed" {
#     metadata = {
#         kind = "subnet"
#     }
#    image_id = "${nutanix_subnet.next-iac-managed.id}"
#}
### Cluster Data Sources
#data "nutanix_image" "test" {
#    metadata = {
#        kind = "image"
#    }
#    image_id = "${nutanix_image.test.id}"
#}

### Image Resources (Managed by the Image Service)

## Related Developer Docs:

###
### Images are raw ISO, QCOW2, or VMDK files that are uploaded by a user can be
###attached to a VM.
### An ISO image is attached as a virtual CD-ROM drive, and QCOW2 and VMDK files
### are attached as SCSI disks.
### For self service portal use cases: An image has to be explicitly added to
### the self-service catalog before users can create VMs from it.

# This demo used a single dummy image from a local filer. Multiple images can be
#   presented here as separate resources, or existing images on a cluster can be
#   called in as data sources, which you can see in the data sources section
#   above.

## Implementation Notes on Subnets
# Subnets are virtual networks (VLANs) and can either be standard L2 VLANs or
# standard L2 VLANs with additional L3 IPAM provided by Acropolis.
#
# Using Managed Networks (aka AHV's internal IPAM) allows AHV to fully control IP
# address assignment, and the DHCP DORA request does not even hit the wire. This
# can be used where AHV fully manages the DHCP environment *OR* it can be used
# with 3rd party IPAMs, where AHV does *NOT* have any DHCP pool; however, still
# has the capability to deterministically pass in layer 3 IPv4 addresses.
#
# This is especially interesting for environments that already have a 3rd party
# IPAM, as it gives you two options:
# Option A: Use the 3rd party IPAM exactly how you'd use it anywhere else, in
#           which case you'd just set up AHV's VLANs as standard L2 VLANs, and
#           then have the enterprise network setup just like usual.
# Option B: Use AHV's managed networks as a very neat way to inject IP addresses
#           into VMs, instead of using anything on the physical network side to
#           act as an IP Helper/DHCP relay.
#
# More specifically, with "Option B" you can create a "managed" network in AHV via
# terraform that doesn't have a DHCP pool assoicated, then using the assign IP
# address feature to "pass" that static IP into the guest as an acropolis
# managed IP.
#
# Let me be clear: This helps avoid physical network switch configuration as well
# as any dependency on things like cloud-init or sysprep to statically assign an
# IP address. This you could grab an IP as a resource from a 3rd party IPAM, and
# pass that IP Object into the VM via this feature, without having to interact
# with your physical network team at all.
#
# Note: an AHV managed IP address will "stick" with the VM from cradle to
# grave, even if the VM is off.

# ### Define Terraform Managed Subnets

  # What cluster will this VLAN live on?

## Implementation Notes on VMs
